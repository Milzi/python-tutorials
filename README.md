# Version

There are currently two major versions of Python. The older Python2 and
the newer Python3. We use Python3, where the latest stable release is
3.6.0 (as of 12 Mar 2017).

# Packages
are called *modules* in python

## Standard Library (Batteries Included)

## Favorite Non-Standard Packages

### NumPy
fast numerical computing, in particular with large arrays and matrices; is part of SciPy, but can also be loaded individually

  Numpy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/)

### SciPy
(large) scientific computing library, based on NumPy arrays (and including NumPy)

### scikit-learn
machine learning, built to work well with NumPy and SciPy

# TODOs
- [X] pull every jupyter notebook with number from python-for-data-science
- [ ] check the setup part for anaconda & friends (let's say as number 0)

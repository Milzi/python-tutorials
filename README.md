# Packages
called *modules* in python

## Standard Library (Batteries Included)

## Favorite Non-Standard Packages

- NumPy :: fast numerical computing, in particular with large arrays and matrices; is part of SciPy, but can also be loaded individually
- SciPy :: (large) scientific computing library, based on NumPy arrays (and including NumPy)
- scikit-learn :: machine learning, built to work well with NumPy and SciPy

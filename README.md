# python-tutorials

This repository contains
- setup instructions for a minimal python environment and 
- Jupyter notebooks to train and test the basic concepts of python

Prerequisite
- programming experience, i.e. familiarity with basic concepts like
  control flow and data structures

# Version

There are currently two major versions of Python. The older Python2 and
the newer Python3. We use Python3, where the latest stable release is
3.6.0 (as of 12 Mar 2017).

# Packages
are called *modules* in python

## Standard Library (Batteries Included)
### math
It provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

### sys
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.

### traceback
This module provides a standard interface to extract, format and print stack traces of Python programs. It exactly mimics the behavior of the Python interpreter when it prints a stack trace.

### array 
This module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.

## Favorite Non-Standard Packages

### NumPy
fast numerical computing, in particular with large arrays and matrices; is part of SciPy, but can also be loaded individually

  Numpy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/)

### SciPy
(large) scientific computing library, based on NumPy arrays (and including NumPy)

### scikit-learn
machine learning, built to work well with NumPy and SciPy

### matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

# TODOs
- [X] pull every jupyter notebook with number from python-for-data-science
- [ ] check the setup part for anaconda & friends (let's say as number 0)
